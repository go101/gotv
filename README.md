# gotv (Go Toolchain Version)

**gotv** is tool which provides a way to manage multiple versions of the official Go toolchain.
It is kinda of a re-implementation of [gvm](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm) but with a different command set.
Each Go toolchain version is built from the Go git repository.

This tool is mainly built for me to check differeces of official Go toolchain verisons during writing [Go 101 books](https://go101.org).

## Installation and Usage

Please visit https://go101.org/apps-and-libs/gotv.html for details.
