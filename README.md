# gotv (Go Toolchain Version)

**gotv** is a tool which manages multiple versions of the official Go toolchain installations on the same computer.
It is kinda of a re-implementation of [gvm](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm) but with a different command set.

This tool is mainly built for me to check behavior differences of different Go toolchain versions during writing [Go 101 books](https://go101.org).

## Installation and Usage

Please visit https://go101.org/apps-and-libs/gotv.html for details.
